# Data Structures in C

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures in C. Currently, it includes programs for:

- **Singly Linked List**
- **Doubly Linked List**
- **Stack(ARRAY) & Stack(Linked List)**
- **Queues(ARRAY) & Queues(Liked List)**

## Features

- Insertion (beginning, end, and specific positions)
- Deletion (beginning, end, and specific nodes)
- Traversal (forward and backward for doubly linked lists)


## Future Plans

I will be adding more data structures, such as stacks, queues, and trees.



Feel free to explore and contribute!
